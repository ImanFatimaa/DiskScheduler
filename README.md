# DiskScheduler
# Introduction:  
In operating systems, disk scheduling is a crucial component responsible for optimizing the order in which disk I/O requests are serviced. Its primary objective is to minimize seek time and maximize disk throughput, thereby enhancing overall system performance. Disk schedulers achieve this by employing various algorithms to determine the most efficient sequence for accessing disk blocks, considering factors like the current position of the disk arm, pending I/O requests, and disk access patterns. By intelligently managing disk access, disk schedulers play a pivotal role in enhancing system responsiveness and resource utilization in modern computing environments.
# Objective: 
The objective of the disk scheduler project is to design and implement efficient disk scheduling algorithms in operating systems. This involves studying and analyzing different scheduling techniques such as FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, and more. The project aims to develop a software module capable of optimizing disk I/O performance by selecting the most appropriate scheduling algorithm based on system workload and characteristics. Additionally, it seeks to evaluate the performance of these algorithms through simulations and practical experiments to assess their effectiveness in reducing disk seek time and enhancing overall system throughput.
